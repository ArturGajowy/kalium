# kalium

A Java binding to [Networking and Cryptography](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/) library by [Daniel J. Bernstein](http://cr.yp.to/djb.html).

This is a fork of abstractj's [kalium](https://github.com/abstractj/kalium) project, which includes the `libsodium` dependency on selected platforms.

Like the [upstream project](https://github.com/abstractj/kalium), all the hard work of making a portable NaCl API version was done by [Frank Denis](https://github.com/jedisct1) on [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium).

## Requirements

* JDK 7 or [higher](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/)
